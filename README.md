# Text Editor Redux

This is a _really_ simple text editor I made using Godot.

Have fun with it, I guess.

## Features

- Create and/or open UTF-8 text files.
- Read and edit UTF-8 text files.
- Save UTF-8 text files.
- Prompts to avoid quitting without saving.
  - Tracks saved state.
- Line numbers.
- Optional minimap.
- Optional text wrapping.
- 'About' dialog.

## Known Issues

- The set states of options are not saved, and must be reset every run.
- No mechanism to prevent opening non-text files.

## Development Plans

- Literally none.

Feedback, suggestions, and bug reports will be read, but I cannot guarantee I will do anything about them.
